  <h2>Electrical Engineering Experience</h2>

  <h3>Electrical Engineer I/II at St. Jude Medical/Abbott Laboratories (Sep. 2014 to Apr. 2019)</h3>
  <p>My first job after college was working as electrical engineer at St. Jude Medical's CRM (Cardiac Rhythm Mangament)
  Division. After a couple years here, I was eventually promoted to an Electrical Engineer II</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Worked as a collaborating team member for a design/development team responsible for creating both
            life-sustaining and quality-of-life implantable devices (pacemakers, ICDs, Neuromodulators etc.). Duties
            involved working with others on schematic design reviews, component evaluation, product characterization,
            failure mode analysis, design input requirements, etc.</li>
    <li>Design and implement test circuitry using our ICs in development to create fully programmable and
            testable prototypes of our future products. These prototype boards act as fully functional devices and allow
            for design verification of pacing output, sensing capability, crosstalk, etc.</li>
    <li>Developed programmable hardware such as load boxes and wrote code to automate hundreds of combinations
            required for characterization testing by controlling oscilloscopes and power supplies in order to reduce
            test time from hours to minutes. This code was used by other groups and departments saving company time.</li>
    <li>In addition to working in the design/development team,  also supported the Quality, Manufacturing, and
            Fault Isolation departments by troubleshooting design verification and validation test setups, reviewing
            manufacturing process changes, and conducting root cause analysis on several field return devices.</li>
    <li>Conducted EMI and MRI testing on implantable pacemakers to meet relevant standards (ex. ISO 14117:2012).
            Tests included RF Injection testing (64MHz and 128MHz), Static Magnet Testing at 1.5T an 3T, and EMI \
            testing up to 3GHz.</li>
    <li>Represent the Electrical Hardware Development team in large multidisciplinary groups by presenting
            completed deliverables and providing updates on progress. Create timelines by resource planning and
            researching necessary steps for projects, collaborate with other groups and delegate tasks to coworkers
            to meet deadlines. </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Design Systems Engineer at Flex Medical (Apr. 2019-Apr. 2021)</h3>
  <p>At Flex Medical I worked as both a support and technical lead in a design/development team for an infusion pump.
      Duties involved working with system requirements, tracing with electrical, software, and mechanical requirements,
      designing system architecture, review of subsystem design documents, and general support for the design and
      development team.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed a test fixture for infusion pump prototypes to support automated testing for development.
            Created a specification and guided the test fixture through to completion. Each test fixture individually
            tested by me and later used to test several prototype boards. </li>
    <li>Learned Python to create several different test scripts in for design requirement verification as well
            as characterization. Created a test script launcher with C# in Visual Studio to allow users the flexibility
            of altering test plans with ease. </li>
    <li>Reviewed several multidisciplinary documents as technical lead including Electrical, Software, and
            Mechanical architecture documents. Provided important feedback from a systems perspective on integration
            issues, and compliance for standards or system requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Senior MRI Engineer at St. Jude Medical/Abbott Laboratories (Apr. 2021 to Jan. 2023)</h3>
    <p>I returned to Abbott in 2021 this time working in the NMD (Neuro Modulation Division)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Worked as a subject matter expert and individual contributor working on proving MRI safety in
         Neuromodulation devices (SCS, DBS, and DRG) and leads.</li>
      <li>Worked as lead for ISO 10974 compliance testing and analysis such as combined fields testing, RF induced
            heating and header voltage, etc.</li>
      <li>Worked on developing 3.0T MRI scanner compliance testing capability (RF Injection and Header Voltage
            testing tools).</li>
      <li>Worked as SME for developing electrical tools/circuits to support Design Verification and Validation
            activities. Tools included device to measure induced voltage during MRI induced voltages as well as
            developed PCBs to perform high frequency bench testing on implantable devices.</li>
      <li>Resident SME on MRI team for electrical knowledge on implantable device electrical system and circuit
            analysis.</li>
      <li>Created engineering reports documenting design verification or validation testing and collaborated in
            cross functional teams (mechanical, systems, software, etc.) to complete deliverables on time.</li>
    </ul>
